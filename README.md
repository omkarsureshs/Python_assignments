# 🐍 Python Assignments

Welcome to the **Python Assignments Repository**!  
This repository documents my learning journey in **Python programming**, starting from the fundamentals and gradually progressing toward mastering the language with clarity and precision.

Each program focuses on a specific concept and is written to strengthen problem-solving skills and core programming logic.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository contains multiple Python files, each representing a specific task or concept:

---

## 🧮 A1Task1.py — Basic Arithmetic Operations

**Description:**  
This program accepts **two numerical inputs** from the user and performs basic mathematical operations using the following operators:

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)

The computed results are then displayed to the user.

**Functions Used:**
- `input()` → To receive user input
- `print()` → To display the output

---

## 👋 A1Task2.py — Personalized Greeting

**Description:**  
This program takes the user's **first name and last name** as input (string values).  
It then uses **string concatenation** to combine them into a full name and displays a personalized greeting message.

**Concepts Covered:**
- String input
- String concatenation
- Output formatting

---

## 🔢 A2Task1.py — Odd, Even, or Zero Checker

**Description:**  
This program accepts a **single integer** from the user and determines whether the number is:

- Odd
- Even
- Zero

The decision is made using **conditional statements (`if`, `else`)**, and the result is displayed clearly.

**Concepts Covered:**
- Conditional logic
- Integer comparison

---

## ➕ A2Task2.py — Sum of First 50 Numbers

**Description:**  
This program calculates the **sum of numbers from 1 to 50** using a `for` loop.  
The final sum is displayed in a single, readable sentence.

**Concepts Covered:**
- Loops (`for`)
- Accumulator variables
- Arithmetic operations

---

## A3Task1.py
**Description**
This program is a basic factorial finder for a number given by the user , using a for loop. The final result is resulted as the output with a message!

The cases are:
- If input is less than 0 , we directly convey that negative numbers cannot be calculated for a factorial
- If the input is greater or equal to 0,  we have a certain logic used!

**Concepts Covered:**
- Loops (`for`)
- Factorial Logic

## A3Task2.py
**Description**
This program accepts a **numerical input** from the user and performs various mathematical operations using the `math` module.

**Operations Performed:**
- Square root (`math.sqrt()`)
- Natural logarithm (`math.log()`)
- Sine calculation (`math.sin()`)

The results of each operation are displayed to the user.

**Concepts Covered:**
- `math` module usage
- Mathematical functions
- String formatting (f-strings)

## 📄 A4Task1.py — File Reading with Error Handling

**Description:**  
This program reads the contents of a file named `sample.txt` and displays each line with its line number.  
It includes **exception handling** to gracefully manage errors when the file is not found or other issues occur.

**Concepts Covered:**
- File handling (reading)
- Exception handling (`try`, `except`)
- Loop enumeration
- String stripping

---

## ✍️ A4Task2.py — File Writing and Appending

**Description:**  
This program demonstrates **file manipulation** by:
1. Accepting user input and **writing** it to a file named `output.txt`
2. Accepting additional input and **appending** it to the same file
3. Reading and displaying the final file contents

**Concepts Covered:**
- File handling (writing, appending, reading)
- Context managers (`with` statements)
- User input handling
